# Customizing VS Code Theme

Customizing your VS Code Theme is easier than you thought, I am using Windows and the already awesome Tomorrow Night Blue theme in VS code.

## Create Backup of the current Color Theme

1. Locate your VS code color Theme

Normally your vs code color theme is located in the Microsoft VS Code installation folder.

In my case I am using Windows and my vs installation folder code is located
`C:\Users\myUsername\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code\`

If your main installation folder is located somewhere else, head there and navigate through the folder until you get to the main active color theme.

    ```
    Microsoft VS Code\resources\app\extensions\theme-tomorrow-night-blue\themes
    ```

Full path:
C:\Users\myUsername\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code\resources\app\extensions\AnyActiveTheme\themes

2. Copy the origin JSON file or follow your own Backup method

I just created a folder in my Documents directory and copy and pasted the current JSON file there. Please feel free to create your backup on your own way.

## Modify the Color Theme

My favorite Color Theme is the Tomorrow Night Blue, but there are couple of things that I completely dislike about the theme and I updated to my own taste.

1. Open the Color Theme in your VS Code
